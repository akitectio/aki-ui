# Why Aki UI?

In a landscape filled with React component libraries, Aki UI stands out for several compelling reasons. Here's why you might want to consider Aki UI for your next project:

## Developer Experience First

Aki UI is built with developer experience as a top priority:

- **TypeScript Integration**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions for all components and props.
- **Intuitive API**: Consistent and predictable component API design.
- **Well-documented**: Detailed documentation with examples for every component and feature.
- **Path Aliases**: Cleaner imports with path aliases like `@components` instead of relative paths.

## Performance Optimized

- **Tree-shakable**: Only import what you need, reducing bundle size.
- **Lazy-loadable**: Components can be easily code-split.
- **Minimized re-renders**: Carefully designed to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **Small footprint**: Built with bundle size in mind.

## Tailwind CSS Integration

Unlike other component libraries that force you to learn their custom styling approach, Aki UI leverages the power of Tailwind CSS:

- **Use existing knowledge**: If you know Tailwind, you know how to customize Aki UI.
- **Design system consistency**: Works with your existing Tailwind configuration.
- **No extra CSS-in-JS libraries**: Keeps your bundle size smaller.
- **Easy to extend**: Add your own utility classes alongside Aki UI components.

## Accessibility Focused

- **Color contrast**: Meets WCAG color contrast requirements.

## Flexible Theming

- **Dark mode support**: Built-in support for light and dark modes.
- **Multiple color schemes**: Create and switch between different color schemes.
- **RTL support**: Built-in support for right-to-left languages.

## Modern React Features

- **Hooks-based**: Built using React Hooks for a modern approach.
- **Context API**: Leverages React Context for theme and settings.
- **Functional components**: All components are functional for better performance.
- **React 19 compatible**: Works with the latest React features.
