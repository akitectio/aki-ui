# Grid Component Fix - Responsive Layout Issues

## Issue

The Grid component was not generating proper responsive Tailwind CSS classes, causing layouts to stack vertically on desktop instead of displaying side-by-side as expected.

## Root Cause

- `getResponsiveGridClasses` function was not properly formatting responsive breakpoint classes
- Missing safelist in Tailwind config caused grid classes to be purged
- Breakpoint prefixes were not being applied correctly

## Solution

### 1. Fixed `getResponsiveGridClasses` function

- Properly generates base classes without prefixes
- Correctly formats responsive classes with breakpoint prefixes (e.g., `lg:grid-cols-12`)
- Improved class joining logic

### 2. Added Tailwind safelist

- Grid column classes: `grid-cols-1` through `grid-cols-12` with all breakpoints
- Grid item spans: `col-span-1` through `col-span-12` with all breakpoints
- Row spans and gap classes with responsive variants
- Basic grid utilities: `grid`, `grid-flow-*`

### 3. Added test story

- Created "Language Manager Layout" story demonstrating 4/8 column responsive layout
- Shows proper mobile stacking and desktop side-by-side behavior

## Before vs After

### Before

```jsx
// Generated incorrect classes
<div class="grid grid-cols-base lg:grid-cols-12">  // ❌ Invalid
  <div class="col-span-base lg:col-span-4">       // ❌ Invalid
```

### After

```jsx
// Generates correct classes
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-12">   // ✅ Valid
  <div class="col-span-1 lg:col-span-4">         // ✅ Valid
```

## Impact

- ✅ Grid layouts now work correctly on all screen sizes
- ✅ Responsive breakpoints function as expected
- ✅ 4/8 column layouts display side-by-side on desktop
- ✅ Mobile layouts stack vertically as intended
- ✅ All Tailwind grid classes are preserved during build

## Testing

- Tested with language management layout (4 col form + 8 col table)
- Verified responsive behavior across breakpoints
- Added Storybook story for visual regression testing
